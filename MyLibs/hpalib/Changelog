Change log of the HPA library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Version 1.0 >> Version 1.0a :

The function xchcof() has been modified to remove
a buffer overflow.

Version 1.0a >> Version 1.6 :

The prototypes of the functions xis0(), cxis0(), xnot0() and cxnot0()
have been modified, in order to make the call of these
functions quicker.

The new comparison functions xisPinf(), xisMinf() and
xisordnumb() have been added.

The function xisNaN() has been modified to
remove a bug.

I have added the function xsgn(), to recover
the sign of an extended precision number (+1 to
mean positive value or +Inf, -1 to mean negative
value or -Inf, 0 to mean zero or NaN).

Removed a bug in the functions dbltox()
and flttox().

The output functions xpr_print() and xpr_asprint()
have been modified to correct a bug and
make their execution quicker.

The functions xadd() and xmul() have been improved
with the use of 'register' variables.

Added a C++ wrapper together with the source code
of the sample programs used to test it.

The program 'hpaconf' and the makefiles
have been consequently updated.

Added an SMakefile to use with Smake,
a 'make' utility from Joerg Schilling <schilling@fokus.gmd.de>.

Added the new test program 'txscf.c' to the
test/ directory.

The perl script 'testex' in the test/
directory has been replaced by an executable file.
This is obtained by compiling 'testex.c' .

The documentation has been completely rewritten
by using txt2tags (http://txt2tags.sf.net).

The Copyright statements have been updated
with the new address of the Free Software
Foundation.

Version 1.6 >> Version 1.7 :

The static function ctan() in xtrig.c has been
renamed to c_tan() to prevent compiler warning messages.

A very hazardous bug concerning the functions
strtox() and atox() has been corrected.

An instruction in the files cxaop.c and cxbasic.c,
which prevented them from being compiled with
MS-Visual C, has been changed.

The bug of GCC 4.x which prevents the use of
optimization levels higher than -O and -O1
when compiling HPA is now documented.

The functions xatan2() and xreal::atan2() have been added.

Minor changes in the makefiles.

The documentation has been corrected and updated.

The programmer's manual is now licensed under
GNU Free Documentation License version 1.3.
